start project
>python manage.py startproject django_forms
start app
>python manage.py startapp form_app


1)
register app in installed app of settings.py
go to project url
include the url of the app using form_app.urls (name of the app you created.urls)
url('',include('form_app.urls')),
this is done so that if we include any path/url in our app then it gets automatically called in our project too using form_app.urls


2)
then go to our app url.py here form_app
create paths in urls.py
url('',views.contact),
and make sure to import views
from . import views

3)
now we can go to views.py file nd create contact view in there
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def contact(request):
    return HttpResponse('contact view')

4)now make migrations
>python manage.py makemigrations
>python manage.py migrate

				*******     Contact Us Form    *************

				now we are going to make our first form
				this will be very simple contact form that will going to
				catch the value as soon the user wants to contact us
r

5)go to your app here form_app and create a file forms.py

)import forms
)create form using class (having the subclass forms.Form)
)create fields you want (method is similar to as you crated in models)

##in forms.py
from django import forms
class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        name=forms.charField()
        email=forms.EmailField(Label='E-mail')
        category=forms.ChoiceField(choices=[('question','Question'),('other','Other')])#array of tupples
        subject=forms.CharField(required=False)
        body=forms.CharField(widget=form.Textarea)#widgests are used to represent actual html representation of a vield #by default widget is text input therefore we write widget here to make it large i.e textarea not textinput


6)go to views.py
)and import the form that we created i.e ContactForm

from .forms import ContactForm

)now we will create a variable to store our form

form=ContactForm()

)now we want to return the template and form instead of httpresponse

return render(request, 'form.html', {'forms':form})#form.html is a template and form is the same variable that we created above


7)create templates
now we have to create a folder called templates in our app (form_app)
we have to create a form.html in templates folder
